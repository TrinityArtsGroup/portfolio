    <p>In the digital age, websites are more than just functional; how they are designed plays a crucial role in the user experience. A color theme can influence how users interact with 
    the content, and how effectively they navigate through webpages. A well-designed website will keep people invested, with or without an algorithm feeding the user content. Two such 
    websites are Archive.org and Reddit.com.</p>

    <img src="color/archive.png" alt="Archive.Org" class="side-image">
    <p><a href="http://archive.org">Archive.org</a>, also known as the Internet Archive, is a nonprofit digital library that offers access to millions of archived web pages, books, movies, 
    music, and other media. The site has a design that is at once somehow retro feeling and distinctly practical. It’s color choices evoke a sense of nostalgia and seriousness. It uses a 
    combination of light beige, gray, and dark text colors which is appropriate, given it’s a platform focused on preserving historical data. The site's background is primarily a warm 
    off-white or light gray, which helps create a neutral environment that doesn't take away from the content itself, with well-utilized whitespace. The overall color palette doesn’t 
    distract from the content itself but instead emphasizes a sense of professionalism and gravitas, making it easier for users to focus on the wealth of information at their fingertips.</p>

    <section class="wrap-section">
    <p>Which is in complete contrast, metaphorically and spiritually to <a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a>, an online platform where users can submit content and engage in discussions. 
    Reddit is organized into various subreddits (user-created communities), each with its own focus. As one of the most visited websites in the world, Reddit's color theme reflects its 
    community oriented vibe. The most prominent color is red, especially in the logo. The red tone used is bright and energizing, evoking a sense of urgency. It’s often associated with 
    excitement and passion in most corners of the world, which is fitting for a platform full of discussions and debates. </p> <img src="color/reddit.png" alt="Reddit" class="side-image">

  <section class="wrap-section only-text">
    <p>In other words, Archive.org utilize a minimalist approach, whereas Reddit uses a maximalist one. Archive.org focuses on clarity and simplicity, using colors that don’t compete with the 
    content. This approach ensures that users can focus on research without being visually overwhelmed. Reddit, however, is designed to keep users engaged and encourage participation through 
    bright colors and clear visual hierarchies. This is reflected in the dynamic design that changes depending on user interactions and upvotes.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="wrap-section only-text">
    <p>The color schemes of these two websites not only enhance the user experience but also subtly reinforce the core purpose of each platform: one for research and preservation, the other 
    for real-time social interaction and content sharing. By understanding the role color plays in shaping a website’s identity, we can better appreciate how design choices influence user 
    behavior and engagement in the digital landscape.</p>
