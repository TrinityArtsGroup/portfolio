        <p><em>Colour T.V. - "Locked Out"</em></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Colour T.V. was an alternative group out of Sussex County, NJ. I previously played<br>
        with 2/3rd's of the group in a different project called "Young American Artists". I <br>
        designed the album artwork in the style of JD Salinger's paperback covers.</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="audio/datura.jpg" alt="Datura" width="200" height="200">
        <p><em>Datura - "Crossed"</em></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Datura was a post-rock band formed while attending the School of Visual Arts.<br>
        I played bass and did background vocals. Datura was a frequent presence at the <br>
        now defunct bar Don Hills in the Bowery district of New York City. I left the group <br>
        in 2009 to focus on working in the theatre company, Dangerous Ground Productions.</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="audio/spanishdracula.png" alt="Spanish Dracula" width="200" height="200">
        <p><em>Spanish Dracula - "Paint Me a Picture"</em></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Spanish Dracula was the brain child of my brother, Christopher. After being impressed<br>
        with an earlier project of mine (the punk rock group Aguirre) he invited me to sing and write<br>
        in this alternative / grunge quartet. We played frequently over the NY area, and released three<br>
        EP's before falling victim to the COVID pandemic, when some members moved out of state.</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="audio/oldmanisme.JPG" alt="Old Man is Me" width="200" height="200">
        <p><em>Old Man is Me - "Buffalo Skinners"</em></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Old Man is Me reunited me with my former bandmate Paul Alan (of Aguirre and Colour T.V.) <br>
        with a focus on blues and folk music. Recording started in as early as 2020. The video below was<br>
        edited utilizing public domain footage, and is a alternative arrangement of the folk standard<br>
        "Buffalo Skinners" first performed by Leadbelly in the 1900's, and popularized by Pete Seeger<br>
        during the folk revival of the early 1960's.</li>
        </ul>
