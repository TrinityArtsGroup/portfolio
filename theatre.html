      <h2><em>"Servers"</em> (2012)</h2>
    <p>This 2012 independent project, successfully funded on Kickstarter, was a unique experience in that it combined the excitement of live theater 
    with the compositional beauty of television. As an official entry in the 2012 <a href="https://undergroundzeronyc.org" target="_blank">undergroundzero festival</a> the play 
    was a riff on the live televison dramas of the 1950's, taking inspiration from Rod Serling, Paddy Chayefsky, Sidney Lumet, and Jack Klugman. It was performed 
    live from the Clemente Soto Velez Cultural Center for three succesive nights in downtown Manhattan.</p></div>

  <h2><em>"John Cassavetes' Husbands"</em> (2010)</h2>
  <p>This 2010 reinterpretation of Cassavetes' divisive work from 1970 was produced as part of New York's prestigious Under the Radar Festival. Designed in part as an homage to the 
  emotionally raw filmmaking style the director was known for. The three-hour play explores male friendship, grief, and recklessness in a modern context - utilizing projection and 
  live camera feeds to blend the lines between theater and film. The film three middle class men in the throes of a midlife crisis following the death of a close friend. Cassavetes' 
  shadow looms large over the production, his name even takes the place of the "dead friend" in the film, who was named "Stuart" in the film.</p>

      <h2><em>"For Every Evil Under the Sun"</em> (2009)</h2>
    <p>This 2009 project was done as part of a independent study course at the School of Visual Arts, and it's production directly overlapped with the original 2009 SVA incarnation of "Husbands",
      which was performed for the first time shortly after this piece premiered. It was also the first live performance ever conducted at what is now known as the SVA Theatre on 23rd St. It features 
      two of the three leads of that play, that of Francis Oberle and Anthony LaForgia. The play's original program notes the story as follows: "A one-act play about violence." The play was performed 
      for three nights in May of 2009, and one of those nights was recorded and later edited. It is available below in its entirity.</p>
