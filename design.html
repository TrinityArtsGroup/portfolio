        <h2>Acryllic / Collage Examples</h2>
        <p>These are a few examples of my work in acrylics and collage. I have been working in this medium since 2020.</p>
        <img src="design/ahab.png" alt="Ahab" width="500" height="400">
        <p><em>"...Ahab Stands Alone"</em> (2020)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This piece was inspired by the novel "Moby Dick" by Herman Melville. It is my brother's favorite book<br>
            and I wanted to create something that he would appreciate. The piece is acryllic on canvas, and is three<br>
            dimensional in nature. It utilizes driftwood, seashells and the remains of a horseshoe crab found all on<br>
            location in Orleans, MA in September of 2020.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="design/crime1.png" alt="Crime01" width="350" height="500">
        <p><em>"Crime of the Century"</em> (2019) - First Version</p>
        <ul> 
        <li>This piece was inspired by a screenplay entitled "Jafsie" that is based on the infamous 1932 Lindbergh<br>
            Kidnapping Case that was told from an unorthodox point of view: that of the go-between for the Lindbergh's<br>
            and the kidnappers - a 78 year old school teacher named Dr. John F. Condon (J.F.C). It was the first canvas<br>
            I ever designed. Utilizing all kinds of mixed media, from vellum and acrylic to cardstock. Above is the first<br>
            version from 2019, which was gifted to the co-author of the screenplay.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="design/crime2.png" alt="Crime02" width="350" height="500">
        <p><em>"Crime of the Century"</em> (2020) - Second Version</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This is the second version of the piece, which I kept for myself. It is a more refined version of the<br>
            original, and was created in 2020. The piece is intended to evoke media's cavalier attitude and sheer focus<br>
            on bottom line, the nature of the world's first celebrity, and how a child's life got lost in the shuffle.</li>
        </ul>
         <img src="design/dallas.png" alt="Dallas" width="350" height="500">
        <p><em>"Forgive Dallas"</em> (2021)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This piece was inspired by the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, a favorite subject of poet<br>
            Tohm Bakelas, of which this was a commission. It is a collage piece similar to the Lindbergh collage, but it<br>
            pushes further - integrating newspaper clippings, photo paper, vellum, acryllic, 16mm film strips, dye, and<br>
            caro syrup. It even utilizes several vintage Kennedy political buttons. Bellow is the poet proudly displaying<br>
            the finished canvas.</li>
        </ul>
