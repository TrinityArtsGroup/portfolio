    <div class="art-text">
      <h3><em>"...Ahab Stands Alone"</em> (2020)</h3>
      <p>This piece was inspired by the novel "Moby Dick" by Herman Melville. It is my brother's favorite book and I wanted to 
      create something that he would appreciate. The piece is acrylic on canvas, and is three dimensional in nature. It utilizes 
      driftwood, seashells and the remains of a horseshoe crab found all on location in Orleans, MA in September of 2020.</p>

      <h3><em>"Crime of the Century"</em> (2019) - First Version</h3>
      <p>This piece was inspired by a screenplay entitled "Jafsie" that is based on the infamous 1932 Lindbergh Kidnapping Case 
      that was told from an unorthodox point of view: that of the go-between for both the kidnappers and the Lindberghs—a 78-year-old 
      Bronx school principal named Dr. John F. Condon (J.F.C). It was the first canvas that I ever designed. Utilizing all kinds of 
      mixed media, from vellum and acrylic to cardstock. Above is the first version from 2019, which was gifted to the co-author of 
      the screenplay, Mark Lechner.</p>

      <h3><em>"Crime of the Century"</em> (2020) - Second Version</h3>
      <p>This is the second version of the piece, which I kept for myself. It is a more refined version of the original, and was 
      created in 2020. Whereas the first version focused primarily on the newspaper media's cavalier attitude and the nature of 
      America's first celebrity, this second version puts a spotlight directly on little Charlie himself, and how his life got 
      lost in the maelstrom.</p>

    <div class="art-text">
      <h3><em>"Forgive Dallas"</em> (2021)</h3>
      <p>This piece was inspired by the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, a favorite subject of poet Tohm Bakelas, of 
        which this was a commission. It is a collage piece similar to the Lindbergh collage, but it pushes even further—integrating 
        newspaper clippings, photo paper, vellum, acrylic, 16mm film strips, dye, and caro syrup. It even utilizes several vintage 
        Kennedy political buttons.</p>

    <div class="art-text">
    <h3><em>Bending Towards Justice</em> (2021)</h3>
    <p>Originally commissioned for neighbors who were moving out of state, and later recomissioned by a family friend to hang in their
    company's HR office. This painting features the iconic Black Power fist behind the classic liberation colors of red, black, green and 
    yellow. The canvas utilizes mixed media of cryllic, vellum and photo paper. Sections of the fist are overlayed with iconic black artists,
    musicians, thinkers and activists; both famous and forgotten. Including Malcolm X, John Coltrane, Maya Angelou, George Floyd, Leadbelly, 
    Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter, Olympian Tommie Smith, and many more.</p>
