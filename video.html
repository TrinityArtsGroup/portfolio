        <p><em>"Our Hometown"</em> (2013)</p>
        <p>Produced in 2013 in honor of the town's centennial, and in conjunction with the Denville<br>
        Historical Society, I wrote, produced, shot, and directed the following documentary feature.<br>
        It was included with other items of import to be sealed within the centennial vault, which is<br>
        housed in the  municipal building. The vault is scheduled to be reopened in 2113.</p>

        <p><em>"A Tug of War"</em> (2025)</p>
        <p>This was an animation project completed utilizing Adobe Animate. By utilizing two elements<br>
        Iâ€™ve used previously in the course; I tried to come up with a simple, clear, and funny little<br>
        animation. I was aiming for an Abbott and Costello, or Laurel and Hardy type feeling.</p>
