  <h1>Rutgers Class Showcase</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my showcase page! Here, you can explore various projects I've completed during my time at Rutgers. Each project reflects my learning journey and the skills I've developed 
  in design, animation, and restoration.</p>

  <section class="wrap-section">
  <div class="wrap-inline">
  <h2>Business Card</h2>
  <div class="wrap-inline">
    <label class="image-toggle-card glow-hover">
      <input type="checkbox">
      <img src="showcase/card1.png" alt="Card Front" class="card-image front">
      <img src="showcase/card2.png" alt="Card Back" class="card-image back">
    </label>
    <p>I cannibalized the logo of an earlier production company I had as brand marker for the front of the card. I utilized Adobe Stock to download a template that matched the overarching style
    of the company (which is meant to evoke nostalgia, as the business is geared towards film and negative restoration and digital transfers). Hover over the front card image to see the reverse.</p>

    <h2><em>"A Tug of War"</em>- Adobe Animate Example</h2>
    <div class="wrap-inline">
    <video controls width= "250" class="card-video">
    <source src="showcase/final-project-no-1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
    <p> By utilizing two elements I’ve used previously in the course, I tried to come up with a simple, clear, and funny little animation. Through classic tweening, I made two 4 second 
    loops to simulate the back-and-forth pushing and pulling the turkey was doing. I did likewise for the elephant’s back and forth movement. I was aiming for an Abbott and Costello, or 
    Laurel and Hardy type feeling, and hopefully I’ve achieved it.</p>

      <h2>Photo Restoration</h2>
      <div class="wrap-inline">
    <label class="image-toggle-photo glow-hover">
      <input type="checkbox">
      <img src="showcase/before.png" alt="Before Photo Restoration" class="card-image front">
      <img src="showcase/after.png" alt="After Photo Restoration" class="card-image back">
    </label>
    <p>This project meant a lot to me, as I chose for this restoration a baby photo of my maternal grandfather: Warren Seward Hopkins. It was so exciting to learn a bit more about my 
    mother’s side of the family – while simultaneously getting the best photo for the project’s needs.</p>

    <h2><em>"Fantomas"</em> Magazine Cover</h2>
  <div class="wrap-inline">
    <img src="showcase/mag.jpg" alt="Magazine Cover" class="side-image">
    <p>I remember seeing a poster for the forgotten 1931 thriller Fantomas in one of the auditoriums at the School of Visual Arts and the logotype always stuck with me, as did the name. I took that kernel of an idea and ran with it – exploring my latest interests with the undersung classic comedian Buster Keaton, in his many hats as actor, director, writer and stunt person – as well as the author Charles Beaumont and the near completely forgotten 1960’s television artist and actor-writer Ernie Kovacs. The main image utilized is a publicity photo of Buster Keaton taken on set of his famous 1928 film <em>"The Cameraman"</em>, now in the public domain.</p>

    <h2>Social Media Ad</h2>
    <div class="wrap-inline">
    <img src="showcase/social-ad.jpg" alt="Ad Graphic" class="side-image">
    <p>I thought deeply on the legacy of the brand name (the name “Trinity” was my father’s pipefitting business for 30+ years), the history New Jersey has in film (motion pictures originated in New Jersey), how individual fonts can evoke specific emotions, and how taglines can imprint themselves upon demographics. As the saying goes, “brevity is the soul of wit”.</p>
