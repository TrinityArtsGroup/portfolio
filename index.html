    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="index/aboutme.png" alt="Patrick Flynn" width="200" height="200">
    <p>My name is Patrick Flynn, and I am a filmmaker, musician and artist working in the media industry <br>
    for the last ten years. In that time, I have written and directed documentary features, narrative short <br>
    films, and plays for the stage. I have written multiple screenplays in that time period, and have produced<br>
    and recorded music for a variety of genres. I have worked as a video editor for NBC-Universal, and<br>
    edited narrative feature films and done extensive work as an editor of bluray content for several features.<br>
    Since 2020, I have begun work in acrylics and collage-work on canvas. Several of my pieces have been<br>
    recomissioned over the years due to demand.</p>

    $5.00 per tape should you have ten (10) or more in your order. There is no present discount for negative <br>
    film due to the age of the materials and the labor involved.</p>

    <h2>Current Projects</h2>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="index/thehardfall.png"><em>The Hard Fall</em></a>: Envisioned as an eight-episode 
    true crime podcast about the legal odyssey of Jimmy <br> and Camille Landano, this project has just been awarded 
    a 2025 grant by <a href="https://www.puffinfoundation.org" target="_blank">The Puffin Foundation.</a> It<br> 
    attempts to demystify the complicated judicial process by utilizing legal and law enforcement experts, <br>
    archival interviews, and scripted scenes with actors to achieve a semblance of the truth and to humanize <br>
    the story of Prisoner #59554 in Rahway State Prison: Vincent J. Landano and how his circle of supporters <br>
    became larger (including a disaffected juror and a recanted eyewitness) as Prosecutors, Judges, and the <br>
    entire legal apparatus of the State of New Jersey attempts to silence him, his wife, and his legal team.
