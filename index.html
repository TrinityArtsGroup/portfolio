      <p><img src="index/aboutme.png" alt="Patrick Flynn" class="aboutme-img">
      My name is Patrick Flynn, and I am a filmmaker, musician, and artist working in the media industry for the last ten years. In that time, I have 
      written and directed documentary features, narrative short films, and plays for the stage. I have written multiple screenplays, and produced and 
      recorded music across a variety of genres. I have worked as a video editor for NBC-Universal, edited narrative feature films, and done extensive 
      Blu-ray editing for several releases. Since 2020, I have also pursued acrylics and collage on canvas. Several of my works have been recommissioned 
      due to demand.</p>

        </table>

        <p>A $5.00 per-tape discount is applied to orders of ten or more. However, there is no discount on film negative transfers due to the age of materials 
        and the labor involved.</p>
        <p><strong>Please note:</strong> <em>Due to the advanced age of the majority of materials we work with, we are not liable for any damage that may 
        occur during the digitization process.</em></p>

        <h3>"The Hard Fall"</h3>
        <p>Envisioned as an eight-episode true crime audio drama about our broken criminal justice system and the lengths a man will go through to prove his innocence. 
        It's a tale of banal bureaucratic indifference, stalwart determination, and an inspiring love story born through conversation. As the entire legal apparatus of 
        the State attempts to silence him, his wife, and his legal team; a network of unlikely allies — including a disaffected juror and a recanted eyewitness emerge.
        This project attempts to demystify the whole entire judicial process by utilizing legal and law enforcement experts, archival interviews, and scripted scenes 
        with actors to achieve some semblance of the truth. It is our goal to humanize the story of Prisoner #59554 in Rahway State Prison: V. James Landano, and how 
        ironclad his resolve truly became in the face of insurmountable odds.</p>
        <p>This project has been awarded a 2025 grant by <a href="https://www.puffinfoundation.org" target="_blank">The Puffin Foundation</a>.</p>
